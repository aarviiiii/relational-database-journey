## 🔍 Lecture 04: Finally Understanding CRUD (The Real Actions)

### Topics I Covered

This lecture was all about what I can *actually do* with the data once the tables exist.  
I finally started to learn the famous four operations every app is built on — **CRUD**.

* I learned what **CRUD** stands for: **Create, Read, Update, Delete** — the four actions every app performs.
* I discovered that **`INSERT`** (not `CREATE TABLE`) is the real *Create* operation in CRUD.
* I learned how to properly add data using the **Right Way** of `INSERT` by always specifying columns.
* I learned how to insert **multiple rows at once**, which is more efficient than repeating single inserts.
* I understood why **`SELECT`** is the most important command in real apps (reads happen way more than writes).
* I learned why using **`SELECT *`** is a bad habit in real applications (slow, wasteful, brittle).
* I practiced writing clean SELECT queries.
* I finally understood SQL’s “weird” **execution order**, which explains why certain things don’t work the way I expect.
* This lecture focused mainly on the **C (Create)** and **R- Read (not completed yet)** parts of CRUD.
