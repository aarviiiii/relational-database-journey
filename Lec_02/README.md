# 🔑 Lecture 02: Unlocking Keys

## Topics I Covered

In this lesson, I dove into the most important concept for organizing tables: **Keys**. I learned how databases uniquely identify rows and create relationships.

* I learned about **Super Keys** (the "overkill" key) and their redundant columns.
* I learned how to find the minimal **Candidate Keys**.
* I defined the **Primary Key** (the "chosen one") and why it's needed.
* I covered **Composite Keys** for when a single column isn't unique.
* I analyzed why an **auto-incrementing `id` column** is the ideal Primary Key.
* I learned how **Foreign Keys** are used to link tables together.
* Finally, I studied the "on delete" rules like **CASCADE** (the domino effect) and **RESTRICT** (the bouncer).
