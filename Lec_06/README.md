# 🚀 Lecture 06: Supercharging My Queries

## Topics I Covered

This lesson was about making my queries *smarter*. I learned how to filter with more advanced operators, how to sort my results, and how to finally change the data.

* I learned the `BETWEEN` operator as a shortcut for checking ranges.
* I learned the `LIKE` operator for pattern matching (using `%` and `_` wildcards).
* I figured out how to check for empty values using `IS NULL` (and that `= NULL` is a trap!).
* I learned `ORDER BY` to sort my results (`ASC`/`DESC`) and how to use tie-breakers.
* I learned `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` to create pagination (like for Google's pages).
* I *finally* learned the "U" in CRUD: the `UPDATE` command, and why `WHERE` is the most important part.
