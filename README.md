### 🧩 My Relational Database Journey

Decided to finally learn how tables *actually* talk to each other.  
This is me vs. foreign keys, joins, and the occasional “why won’t this query work” meltdown 😅  

#### 💾 What’s Inside
- SQL practice files  
- ER diagrams when I get to that topic  
- Notes, chaos, and small wins  

#### ⚙️ Tools
`MySQL` · `Draw.io` (for now)
