## 🛠️ Lecture 03: Getting My Hands Dirty

### Topics I Covered

This lesson was about moving from pure theory to actually getting my environment set up. I installed the tools, got a practice dataset, and started building my first tables.

* I installed the **MySQL Server** (the "brain") and **Workbench** (the "pretty face").
* I realized I needed a "digital playground" to practice, so I set up the **Sakila database** (a fake movie store).
* I learned how to define table "containers" using **Data Types** (`INT`, `VARCHAR`, `DECIMAL`).
* I studied the "column bouncers" (Constraints) like **`NULL`**, **`NOT NULL`**, **`UNIQUE`**, and **`DEFAULT`**.  
* I learned the "Right Way" to use **`INSERT`** (by specifying columns) and why the "Lazy Way" is a trap.
* I learned how to build my own table "blueprint" using the `CREATE TABLE` command.
