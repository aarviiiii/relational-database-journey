## 🗃️ Lecture 01: Database Foundations

### Topics I Covered

In this lesson, I learned the basics of databases.

* I learned the difference between **Data** (raw facts) and **Information** (data in context).
* I defined what a **Database** is (any organized collection of data).
* I analyzed the major problems with using **plain files** for data storage (like redundancy, inconsistency, and security issues).
* I learned what a **DBMS** (Database Management System) is and how it's the software solution to all those file problems.
