## 🔎 Lecture 05: Filtering at Last!

### Topics I Covered

This is the lecture where I finally got the *real* power. I'm no longer just dumping entire tables; I'm learning to ask for *specific* data.

* I learned to use `DISTINCT` to remove duplicate results.
* I figured out I can use `SELECT` as a calculator (e.g., `SELECT 1+1`).
* I learned how to perform math operations directly on columns (like `SELECT gpa, gpa + 1`).
* I practiced the `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` command to copy filtered data from one table to another.
* I *finally* learned the `WHERE` clause to filter for the specific rows I want.
* I learned how to combine filters using logical operators like `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`.
* I learned *why* parentheses `()` are critical when mixing `AND` and `OR`.
* I found the `IN` operator, which is a super clean shortcut for a long list of `OR`s.

My detailed notes, syntax, and query examples are in `theory05.md`.

This was a lot of new syntax, but it feels like I can actually *find* things now. My brain feels bigger now.
